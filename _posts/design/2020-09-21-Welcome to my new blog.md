## My name is Ron Wolf
I've been working as a professional IT worker since January of 1988.  I've been in the Travel Industry since July of 1998.  I've been an Esperantist since 1999.

I've done Photography since High School.  I took all of the photos that I use on this website.   

I've Cycled since childhood.  My longest one-day ride was 105 miles.  Kayaking is a recent addition.

I consider myself a political independent with Republican leanings.  I find myself agreeing with the Democrats on many social issues, but at the same time I can't agree with them on Abortion.  2016 was the first time in a long while that I didn't vote Republican.  I felt the 2016 election was a case of "Lesser of two Evils".  I couldn't bring myself to vote for either Trump or for Hillary.  I voted for the Libertarian candidate (couldn't tell you his/her name to save my life) as a "none of the above" vote.


### IT work:
  I started programming in 'C', I've worked in Perl, Bourne Shell/Bash, Tal, Ruby, Python, CFEngine, HP SA, Puppet, Chef & Ansible.  I've worked mostly for Fortune 500 companies.  I'm currently working remotely doing Infrastructure Engineering, learning Terraform and Azure.

### Photography:
  I started to college with the intent of becoming a professional photographer.  I switched to Radio/TV and took classes in videography.  I've dabled a little in videography and video editing since. The image at the top of this page is a panographic photo that I took on a trip to Maui.  It is a  Take a look at [*my Flickr site*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/75714303@N00){:target="_blank"} if you want to see my photos. 


### Cycling:
  I've cycled off and on for most of my life.  I picked it up again back in 2011.  Since then I've Cycled over 10,000 miles.  I have a bad back, so I chose a recumbent trike.  I feel the trike is more stable than a bike and less chance of hurting myself.
