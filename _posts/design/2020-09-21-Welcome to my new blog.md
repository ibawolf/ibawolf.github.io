## My name is Ron
I've been working as a professional IT worker since Jan. 2, 1988.  I've been in the Travel Industry since 1998.  I've been an Esperantist since 2000.

I've done Photography since High School.   I've Cycled since childhood.  My longest one-day ride was 105 miles.  Kayaking is a recent addition.

I consider myself a political independent with Republican leanings.  I find myself agreeing with the Democrats on many social issues, but at the same time I can't agree with them on Abortion.  2016 was the first time in a long while that I didn't vote Republican.  I felt the 2016 election was a case of "Lesser of two Evils".  I couldn't bring myself to vote for either Trump or for Hillary.
