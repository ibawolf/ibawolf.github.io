## Hi! My name is Ron Wolf

### IT work:
  I've been working professionally in IT since January of 1988.  I've been in the Travel Industry since July of 1998.  I started programming in 'C', I've worked in Perl, Bourne Shell/Bash, TAL, Ruby, Python, CFEngine, Puppet, Chef & Ansible and through most of it I was a Unix/Linux system adminstrator.  I've worked mostly for Fortune 500 companies.  I'm currently working remotely doing Infrastructure Engineering utilizing common DevOps automation tools, and currently learning Terraform and Azure.

### Photography:
  I've done Photography since High School.  It was my major in college for about a year before I switched to computers.  I took all of the photos that I use on this website.   I started college with the intent of becoming a professional photographer, then I switched to Radio/TV and took classes in videography, then found computers and switched again.  I've dabbled a little in videography and video editing since. The image at the top of this page is a panoramic photo that I took on a trip to Maui.  It is a photo of the clouds rolling up the mountain taken from a high mountain meadow on the side of Haleakala. 

  Take a look at [*my Flickr site*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/75714303@N00){:target="_blank"} if you want to see my photos. 

### Esperanto:
  You've never heard of Esperanto?  Don't feel bad.  Most people in the U.S. have never heard of it unless they know someone like me. (Read this [*blog post*](/blog_posts/What-is-Esperanto/){:target="_blank"}) It's much better known overseas.  I've been an Esperantist since 1999.  I heard about Dr. Zamanhof's International Language in High School while reading a Sci-Fi novel, but I thought it was just something the author of the novel, Mack Reynolds, made up for his story.  I remember thinking at the time that it was a great idea, an easy to learn, neutral language that everyone can learn, used as a common second language for the world.  Too bad so few people have the imagination to see how useful something like this could be and learn it, so far, an estimated 2 million world-wide althought that number is increasing thanks to the internet and Duolingo.com.  I studied one small book on my lunch hours at work and was conversational in the language in about 4 months.  That was after failing high school spanish, and as I was turning 40.

### Cycling:
  I've Cycled since childhood.  I've cycled off and on for most of my life.  I picked it back up again in 2011.  Since then I've Cycled over 10,000 miles.  I have a bad back, so I chose a recumbent trike.  I feel the trike is more stable than a bike and less chance of hurting myself.  My longest one-day ride was 105 miles.
  
  Here's my trike: [the *HP Velotechnik - Scorpion FS 20*](https://www.hpvelotechnik.com/en/recumbent-trikes-bikes/scorpion-adults-recumbent-trikes/scorpion-fs-20-compact-full-suspension-adults-trike/){:target="_blank"}


### Politics:
  I consider myself a political independent with Republican leanings.  I find myself agreeing with the Democrats on many social issues, but at the same time I can't agree with them on Abortion.  2016 was the first time in a long while that I didn't vote Republican.  I felt the 2016 election was a case of "Lesser of two Evils".  I couldn't bring myself to vote for either Trump or for Hillary.  I voted for the Libertarian candidate (couldn't tell you his/her name to save my life) as a "none of the above" vote.


### Kayaking: 
  Kayaking is a recent addition.  I found that I enjoyed it on a "float trip" I took with my grandson.
